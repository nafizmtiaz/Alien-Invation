# Aliens are on the ship!

_welcome to my First project_


<br>

this is my first ever project currently ongoing which is written in python. it is being made with the help of the famous book __Python crash course__ by 
 _eric mathes_. Its a remarkable book for those of you who want to grasp the fundamental concept of Python.

 ## features of this game
 ----
 


 1. its a very basic game build in _pygame_
 2. all it does is shoot the fleet of aliens that appeares on the screen, using __space-bar__
 3. the ship moves left-right with the help of __Arrow-keys__
     - I added a way to move the ship Up-Down though it was not in the book


__Note__: The project has just merely few features, and it hasn't finish yet. So, expect this to be a continuing project for now.
